## About me

I am a Software Engineer who is interested in many things and who loves learning and getting better
in a constant basis. Not to sound like a boring clone of the millions and billions of software engineers
you see out there on the internet and real life, I too love role playing games and going to do outdoors
activities such as bicycling and walking in the forests (or what little of them we have available these
days). Mainly I love life and I love my family, both of these things are just the best and beautiful.
