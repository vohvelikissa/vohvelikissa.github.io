## About me

I am a Software Engineer who is interested in many things and who loves learning and getting better
in a constant basis. Not to sound like a boring clone of the millions and billions of software engineers
you see out there on the internet and real life, I too love role playing games and going to do outdoors
activities such as bicycling and walking in the forests (or what little of them we have available these
days). Mainly I love life and I love my family, both of these things are just the best and beautiful.

### Hobbies

I do story writing for fun. I also like to play with the children that my relatives nowadays have now
that I am not a child myself anymore. Playing video games is also really fun. No matter the platform,
if the game is good, I will play it. Hell even roblox has some surprisingly good stuff these days.
Back when I used to play that game it was not of quality at all whatsoever. Kids these days have it good :D.
Going to the gym is also a thing that I do and it is really fun to me to see how I get progress.

### Interests

Learning more about things like accessibility, software development and how things in general work is
interesting. The thing that I am learning doesnt really have to be anything really very concrete. It can
be something as vaguely defined in reality like politics and metacognition. If I do not immediately know
it I will patiently keep on reading more until I feel like I can grasp the concepts that are relevant to
me. Cooking something good is something that I would like to eventually get into too.

### Volunteering

I am currently giving help to alot of people on the internet in how to learn programming. Additionally
to that I am currently planning to get into volunteering for big LAN events like Assembly, but I am not
yet quite sure how to do such a thing. Mostly I am just actively seeking some people who have questions
that I can answer with certainty and correctly and then I will answer their questions. I am also helping
the next generation of my family tree get somewhere in life and how to avoid the pitfalls that I have 
had problems with.

## Projects

My projects will most likely be created with things like C/C++, java and typescript. Probably not all
mixed up together, but in things where those languages in particular are good and shine to their brightest
levels. I want to make some graphically interesting projects and that I probably will do too.

### Brainfuckdeez

I created a brainfuck interpreter with C. The implementation is pretty simple and the whole entire thing
works in a super simple way, you just import it and then you are ready to use the function that I defined
in the single file in this whole project to run the brainfuck code that you are able to write.

- Tech used: C
- Github: vohvelikissa/brainfuckdeez

### Contfix

I created this contrast fixer because I was shocked that nobody really does anything at all really to get
websites readable. I know now that browsers pretty much walk you through the process of getting the web
be in a good state, but the corporations of nowadays are lazy and do less than nothing to get good and
be good.

- Tech used: javascript
- Github: vohvelikissa/contfix

## Blog

### init

Creating this website to be what it is now was relatively easy even if it required me being roasted by AI
to get better in the process. From now on however I will just continue with this format because this looks
like it will not just break on itself over time. This paragraph could have been a tweet instead of butchering
the concept of blog post, but here we are. Bite me.
