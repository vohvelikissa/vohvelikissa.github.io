# Personal blog or something

I feel like this "blog" or file or a website or whatever you want it to be based on how you read it
is having a bit of a lack of focus and the previous version of this became to be really clusterfucked
with goals that were so numerous and unfocused that I could never have finished them all and have any
results that are worth while. I want to discuss things that I come across while I learn more about
creating things with the tools that are available to me in my favorite os (NixOs) and the internet.

Because I would like to get a job at some point I will be creating some websites and servers with
like the LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) stack or MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, Reactjs, Node.js) or
MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angularjs, Node.js) or WHATEVERTHEFUCK (Whatsapp API, Evernote, typescript,
haskell, emacs lisp, brainfuck). My version of Linux that I will be using will be NixOS because it is
just the fucking best thing ever and no I am not falling to any kind of memes by saying this, I just
have the same smart idea with the other Nix fans.

Beyond having these very general goals that say nothing like learning a languages that is not specific
I want to have things that are very closely related to me made by me. My goals have always been to
have the rights of disabled people and peoples abilities to do just about anything protected. I'm not
yet sure specifically how I could help those people and more with my programming projects, but I am
for sure going to try and figure it out.
