## My Profile

I am a Software Engineer who is really into using different Operating Systems and trying new ones as I
find ones that are compelling enough to be fun to try. Additionally to that I have pretty much always
enjoyed building new things and taking things apart to see how they function. It doesnt really matter
if the thing that I am building or taking apart to learn from is an electronic thing/tool or software, 
I will be taking it apart and hacking it to fit my purposes and my need for learning new things.

My testing of different operating systems is currently pretty much limited to the linux distros that I
can get my hands to because those are the easiest and cheapest ones to try for one time and or a longer
time. The current thing that I am using right now as I am writing too is NixOS and the things that I see
from it like the fact that it is easy to keep it from becoming a big clusterfuck of things like ubuntu is
by default pretty much at this point and I very much like it the most from the distros that I have tried so far.
I have used: Arch, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Debian and NixOS

With All of this operating system testing I want to finally find the one that I am happy with long term.
While NixOS right now seems like the best option for me I will keep looking for a better opportunity for 
me to fix my computer related problems by switching to a new system entirely. Keeping things from having
the opportunity for becoming messy at any point at all whatsoever is what I want my dream operating system
to do while keeping all of my computing on my own machine and not at some cloud thing.

Most of the things that I have taken apart to then use the components of them for something different than the
original purpose have been software because I do not yet own a soldering set or any of the relevant tools 
that I hear from the people that I look up to are useful for things like that. I would like to get into
fixing electronics for some kind of additional money and curiosity because that sounds so cool. It would
also be way more easy to explain to others than using IDA Pro with a AI gateway to vomit the useful code out
to then get something.

My knowledge in software development is mostly in languages like Java, C and C++ and I like creating non web app
apps the most, but I am still very much interested in creating more web and mobile applications of my own too.
In general I want to program things that people will actually use and not just ignore them and move on. I 
want to create value for the people to benefit from and additionally I want it to be lasting. The most dream-like
situation for me would in all honesty be just that, being useful with my code

## My Goals

My first goal is that I want to have my NixOS setup be having all of the packages that I originally listed here
and those were gcc, g++, java, typescript, nodejs. I also wanted to have everything have the tokyonight colorscheme
which is the coolest of them all btw. Also I want to have the dyslexia font to test if it is better or worse than
this default font that came with this operating system / Linux Distro. Yeah, if I can get all of this done that
would be great. I'll list another goal for myself once this is done
