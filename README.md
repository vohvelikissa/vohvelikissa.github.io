## Long term goals

My long term goals have the aspiration to become the best person that I can be
built into them in a very deep way. 

- [ ] run a successful business
- [ ] become a millionaire
- [ ] run a marathon
- [ ] lift 100 kg
- [ ] run 15 km
- [ ] buy a house
- [ ] have kids of my own
- [ ] do something tangible for my country

## How I work during these?

I simply just have a timer that I set to two hours and then I do work as hard
as I possibly can during that time. After that I am just taking a 15 minute 
break just to then repeat the cycle 4 to 5 times per day. This might sound
like a tough deal if you are lazy, but I quarantee and stand by me not being
such thing or even close to it. I work harder than you.

## December to December resolutions 2024-2025

- [ ] Read 12 books
- [ ] Go exercise everyday (atleast a walk)
- [ ] eat properly
- [ ] sleep well

### Exercise notes

Decided to start regular exercise on 2.12.2024 because it is a monday and I had
some really good family time on the first.

### Books that I have read (and what I learned)

#### 5/12 Psychological operations tactics techniques and procedures - Headquarters department of the army

Reading this counts as me checking out and learning something about psyops

#### 4/12 Sotaromaani - Väinö Linna 

This edition of this book has the 1950s censorship round of deletions undone
and marked in cursive. There was alot of details in the publishers notes 
section of the book that were from page 0 to 33, but I didn't really care
about reading them with that much thought into it. I trust that this really old
physical book that I have right next to me is the best version of this book
specifically that I am able to own right at this moment. If some other version
turns out to be better I will check it out and note it here if I decide to 
change from this print from the year 2000.

#### 3/12 The business of sharing - Alex Stephany 

This book is about businesses that make their money by sharing resources such
as cars and items and housing.

- [ ] Make a sharing business app
- [ ] check out JustPark api
- [ ] check out uber api
- [ ] check out lyft api
- [ ] check out voi scooters api
- [ ] check out bird scooters api
- [ ] check out airbnb api
- [ ] check out commu api

#### 2/12 Upeaa Työtä - Lauri Järvilehto 

This book is about finding a good job for yourself and or trying to make 
something for yourself. That as a thing is the biggest motivator for me.
I want to get rich. If I do not get rich, I will infact die trying. Fuck living
as a poor non millionaire engineering student who tries too hard incomparison
to others. And especially fuck you reader.

- [ ] start a business
- [ ] build a contacting list
- [ ] make a swot analysis of myself
- [ ] make that ikigai ball thing

#### 1/12 Tohtori Kuka ja autonien hyökkäys (currently on page 34- Stopped right there because I remembered I had already read this fucking book xD)

As I have been reading this book I cannot stop myself from thinking that the
current Disney run version of Doctor Who is actually just fucking dogshit. In
this book the people who have been introduced in it have had their reasonable
doubts on who or what everything that is alien to them is and have been pretty
normal in all other ways too. 

This book reflects a bit of sexism which I guess was just normal in the 1970s.

### Misc

On the first day of December 2024 this all feels nice and dandy and I want to 
achieve all of my goals.

## 11.12.2024

### My feels during the week

#### Beginning

This week probably will start real slow because of the independence day related
activities that I have coming up. I apologise to myself for the inconvenience.

#### Midway

I barely did anything for a half of this weekly cycle because of the parties
I just had to go to. I'm back to full speed until christmas now.

#### Ending

This week was mostly spent on redefining my goals and partying

### Goals

- [ ] look gc AI/ML
- [ ] look gc Infrastructure
- [ ] look gc Data and analytics
- [ ] look gc Developer tools
- [ ] look gc App development
- [ ] look gc Integration services

- [ ] look gq alpine quantum technologies

- [X] lookup google willow

### Goals achieved

## 4.12.2024

### My feels during the week

#### Beginning

As of late evening 27.11. I feel good for the coming week because I get to
just use my computer for hours and practice using Android Studio and make some
really funny applications. Although I have to complete tasks from the fullstack
open course and those feel like shit honestly to complete, there are some fun
tasks on my plate too and I get to spend time with my family too :)

#### Midway

This week has been slightly slower than what I expected for it to be because
alot of the time that I could have spent working was instead spent gathering 
new information for me to process further into actionable goals. Me having to
help some of my family during the weekend is also a factor that goes into this
and should not be considered a negative because it is a great benefit to have
a family that is well and healthy.

#### Ending

The end for this week ended up being a slower one for personal reasons

### Goals

- [ ] Assembly Game Jam 2025

- [ ] character building video 2

### Goals achieved

Upon further investigation of my goals list I do not want to complete the unity
tasks because the terms of conditions can just fuck me over at any moment
if given the chance. They already tried to fuck over established game devs
not so long ago and I do not have the confidence to say that they will not try
again soon but harder than the last time.

Because the game jams of the year that are locally attendable are pretty much
gone and done with already I will just create three new tasks for this week
that have the names of the hackathons that I want to attend next year. They
will for sure certainly be fun because without fail all of the game jams were
fun that I had the pleasure of attending this year.

For clarity purposes I will have the finishing fullstackopen task split up in
sections in this weeks goals. Apparently I have already completed the first two
of the parts in it so I will be marking those parts as complete from here on
out. I have no idea as to how long completing this god forsaken course in full
so that I will have the opportunity of having 3 free job interviews will take.

The first time that I tried to download android studio this week it crashed my
brave-browser installation. That thing is such a fat piece of shit software
that that can and will happen if you are stupid enough to try android studio
from JetBrains. Be warned, you are not in for a good time or a particularly 
long time. Android will cause cancer.

I started the novel writing course from the youtube channel NovelWriting as the
story writing course that I will be completing here. My initial feel to the thing
is that it seems decent enough for me to spend my time on completing in full.
The views to likes ratio is decent enough that it might not even be botted
and the methodology in the first video sounds nice enough.

To learn how to write good and complex characters I will watch two videos in
full. Namely "How to write fantasy character arcs better than 99 % of writers
by Jed Herne (haha funny last name xD) and "Lecture #9: Characters" by 
Brandon Sanderson. All of this will most likely be fun and I'm excited to 
eventually get around doing it.

## 27.11.2024

### Goals

Becoming a game developer sounds like a fun thing to do professionally so that
is what I am trying to do here

- [X] use android studio for something
- [ ] finish my first godot project
- [X] go through a unity course
- [X] make a unity game
- [ ] attend a game hackathon
- [ ] go through a story building course
- [ ] write a story
- [ ] go through a character building course
- [ ] build a character
- [ ] finish the math courses that are part of my degree
- [ ] finish fullstackopen

### Hope is fleeting

This is the first post that I made right after creating whatever this ends up
being. Keep in mind that I have no idea or plan as to what I want to do with
this. However, the general direction that I want to make my life be is that
I get a job as a professional software engineer.

I'm way too aware of the fact that AI will be fucking me hard

### Goals achieved

# Opinions

The following opinion pieces usually are from my own observations and probably
cannot be verified or replicated in all instances. Usually they will however be
very reasonable and I will show how I got to that conclusion in them. I will 
never for example directly or indirectly say "_ is bad" without having a 
justifiable reason for it. 

## You should actively try to think for yourself

The benefits of thinking really should be obvious, but evidently they are not,
and many of the events that have happened very recently are the proof.
Please, please, please just try to think even for a week when you read something
the answers to the questions that many teachers for text analysis classes tell
you, namely: who, where, how, when and why.

Natural stupidity is fine, but you should still aspire to be better.

- [X] look up psyop tactics
- [ ] look up manipulation tactics
- [ ] figure out how to make tech to detect those
- [ ] play further with these concepts

## I love my family

They are just the best people to be around with.

## People should stop using dating applications

Nearly all of the applications that have been created explicitly for people to
try their luck on getting a date have public profiles for everyone that uses
said app. The data on those profiles usually contain alot of information about
the user that the creator of said profile maybe did not intend to be public
such as how much money they make, what their real education level is or 
where they live.

- [X] check out hinge api

These anti-consumer pieces of shit do not have a public documentation of the
api that their app uses

- [X] check out grindr api

These anti-consumer pieces of shit do not have a public documentation of the
api that their app uses

- [X] check out tinder api

These anti-consumer pieces of shit do not have a public documentation of the
api that their app uses

- [X] check out bumble api

These anti-consumer pieces of shit do not have a public documentation of the
api that their app uses

- [ ] figure out how to abuse each

Having this not transparent at all group of software makes me think that me 
using the word "abuse" above this paragraph here is just incorrect. You cannot
really abuse someone who is themselves an abuser (given that the "counter abuse"
is proportional to the abuse that the abuser makes) and that is just the truth.
It would be a global good to have these glorified silicon valley cocaine addicts
be forced to publicly document their applications workings and be transparent
about how our data is being used.

## NixOS seems really interesting

By installing nixos now I could maybe get rid of the mess that using ubuntu has
left to my computer by not having a clear list of the packages that are installed
not to mention that there is no clear all encompassing list of them. I cannot
even know in a simple way what the fuck is on my computer. I want to have a 
simple way to manage all of my packages.

- [X] download nixos iso
- [ ] install said iso to a usb stick
- [ ] install nixos
- [ ] use nixos
- [ ] configure nixos
- [ ] use nixos

### NixOS notes & skill issues

I chose to start downloading the 64 bit intel/amd version of nixos with the
Intel/AMD architechture. That on the very surface level fits my current comp
very well. I really hope at this point that the installation process goes well
and my life gets better over time with nixos. This might be a long shot and
wishful thinking, but I got hyped enough to even contemplate installing nixos
so it better be good or I'll on bluesky where no one will ever read it.

- [ ] install nvim on nixos
- [ ] make tokyonight the main colorscheme on anything nixos
- [ ] make something lewd the desktop background for the memes and lulz
- [ ] make wideboy Alyx the bash background
- [ ] install android studio on nix
- [ ] install discord on nix
- [ ] install steam on nix
- [ ] install nvm on nix
- [ ] install mysql on nix
- [ ] install c/c++ essentials on nix
- [ ] make the desktop environment be xfce4 on nix

I do not really own a usb stick at this point that can hold nix so I guess I'll
have to get one of those tomorrow.

- [ ] buy a livebootable usb stick
