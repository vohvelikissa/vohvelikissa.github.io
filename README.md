# What I have been upto

I have created a todo list for things that I want to do in the coming year. Those
things are mostly games, but they are also web services and things that use artificial
intelligence in some way. I think I will get through the list that I will soon list 
below in the very early 2025, but I do not yet know what in the specific ways 
know what it is that I am going to do.

- [ ] fps game
- [ ] ai npc
- [ ] hl2 mod
- [ ] minecraft mod
- [ ] google cloud thing
- [ ] a hostable web app
- [ ] lan multiplayer to the fps game on the top of this list

## fps game
