## Day 1

Today on 28.1.2025 I have set an actual schedule for myself, something that I have
lacked for a good decent time right now because I had the possibility for just doing
whatever and still be relatively successful for a little while. The schedule is 
organized around me going to my local library to study and then out from here to
first get some exercise and then from there to home to apply to jobs.

### schedule

- 8-9:45: morning stuff
- 10-16: studying in the library
- 16-18: outdoors activities
- 18-22: applying to jobs

See you tomorrow
