### My feels during the week

#### Beginning

As of late evening 27.12. I feel good for the coming week because I get to
just use my computer for hours and practice using Android Studio and make some
really funny applications. Although I have to complete tasks from the fullstack
open course and those feel like shit honestly to complete, there are some fun
tasks on my plate too and I get to spend time with my family too :)

### Hope is fleeting

This is the first post that I made right after creating whatever this ends up
being. Keep in mind that I have no idea or plan as to what I want to do with
this. However, the general direction that I want to make my life be is that
I get a job as a professional software engineer.

I'm way too aware of the fact that AI will be fucking me hard
