back when she was still alive that the best way to change the future is to start 
living as if you are already there. And even though what she said was heavily 
influenced by her being trans in a time where it was not very accepted at all
whatsoever I am going to take that sentence in the bottom line of that article
out of context and from her of all people because she was and is very inspiring.


The future where I want to live has people actually accept each other as they are
and agree on the fact that while they may disagree on many if not all things, they
still can and will co-operate and even befriend each other. What I will do to get
a more justified future where things are peaceful is still very much a mystery, but
maybe this is the site where I will update things below this paragraph of text as 
I accomplish things most likely with help of a lot of other atleast equally important
people.

The future that I am after would have people be less stupid with their usage of tech
and more mindful of how they use their time. I personally have just decided that 
what want to have my contact to real world look like is very much like this text
file right here. Vim, irssi and many other terminal programs that I use all working
together beautifully with tmux to bring me pretty much everything that I want.

I know that other pople might not enjoy what I enjoy and I believe it shows in what
I do very much because I believe less than a percent of computer users world wide
use NixOS and the software bundles that I have grown to love over the years. I
do not yet know if the why in not so many use these software is really that people
just do not know how to overcome the perceived difficulty of these things.

My personal special area of knowledge that could maybe be used to make peoples lives
better is in information technology and in accessibility. I find it nearly crotesque
that people view accessibility as an afterthought or not a thought at all instead of
it being a thing that is naturally in the very center of design process of different
products and infrastructure. While I do not yet hold a certificate for accessible
design I have still done more for accessibility than the major websites of the world
who are laughably bad at making their designs accessible or even readable for people
with different conditions.

The writing of this site will have me drop checkboxes in this md file that have tasks
that I have assigned for me to do to make this site more informative of the progress
of my mission to make the world a better place.
