### My feels during the week

#### Beginning

As of late evening 27.11. I feel good for the coming week because I get to
just use my computer for hours and practice using Android Studio and make some
really funny applications. Although I have to complete tasks from the fullstack
open course and those feel like shit honestly to complete, there are some fun
tasks on my plate too and I get to spend time with my family too :)

### Goals achieved

Upon further investigation of my goals list I do not want to complete the unity
tasks because the terms of conditions can just fuck me over at any moment
if given the chance. They already tried to fuck over established game devs
not so long ago and I do not have the confidence to say that they will not try
again soon but harder than the last time.

Because the game jams of the year that are locally attendable are pretty much
gone and done with already I will just create three new tasks for this week
that have the names of the hackathons that I want to attend next year. They
will for sure certainly be fun because without fail all of the game jams were
fun that I had the pleasure of attending this year.

For clarity purposes I will have the finishing fullstackopen task split up in
sections in this weeks goals.

### Goals

Becoming a game developer sounds like a fun thing to do professionally so that
is what I am trying to do here

- [ ] use android studio for something
- [ ] finish my first godot project
- [X] go through a unity course
- [X] make a unity game
- [ ] attend a game hackathon
- [ ] go through a story building course
- [ ] write a story
- [ ] go through a character building course
- [ ] build a character
- [ ] finish the math courses that are part of my degree
- [ ] finish fullstackopen

### Hope is fleeting

This is the first post that I made right after creating whatever this ends up
being. Keep in mind that I have no idea or plan as to what I want to do with
this. However, the general direction that I want to make my life be is that
I get a job as a professional software engineer.

I'm way too aware of the fact that AI will be fucking me hard
