# What I have been upto

I have created a todo list for things that I want to do in the coming year. Those
things are mostly games, but they are also web services and things that use artificial
intelligence in some way. I think I will get through the list that I will soon list 
below in the very early 2025, but I do not yet know what in the specific ways 
know what it is that I am going to do.
- [ ] fps game
- [ ] ai npc
- [ ] hl2 mod
- [ ] minecraft mod
- [ ] google cloud thing
- [ ] a hostable web app
- [ ] lan multiplayer to the fps game on the top of this list

## fps game

I would like to make this be some kind of retro game style graphics having thing
not much unlike the thing that I saw in the game dev club gala for my local club.
I want the game to be controlled with qweasdzxc and space bar.

- [ ] create a graphics window
- [ ] make a simple 3d scene with a plane
- [ ] q
- [ ] w
- [ ] e
- [ ] a
- [ ] s
- [ ] d
- [ ] z
- [ ] x
- [ ] c
- [ ] write a super simple story for the game
- [ ] replace the plane with something slightly more advanced

## hostable web app
## lan multiplayer to that fps game

# Dev log

20.12.2024 - I created this current format for this site and planned something for what it is that
I am going to do in the next year. The plans are not really very concrete at this point, but the 
very abstract outlines are in there right now too.

21.12.2024 - wrote my quick thoughts about what I want to make the fps game be like. Listed down
some things that must be done in order to make the game have even the slightest chances of happening.
Cannot wait to actually have the playable game.
