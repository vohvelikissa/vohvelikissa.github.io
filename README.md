back when she was still alive that the best way to change the future is to start 
living as if you are already there. And even though what she said was heavily 
influenced by her being trans in a time where it was not very accepted at all
whatsoever I am going to take that sentence in the bottom line of that article
out of context and from her of all people because she was and is very inspiring.

- [ ] write a paragraph on what I have done for trans people around me
- [ ] make a todo list for projects that my trans friends could like
- [ ] write a paragraph on why I care on each
- [ ] the same on what I learned

The future where I want to live has people actually accept each other as they are
and agree on the fact that while they may disagree on many if not all things, they
still can and will co-operate and even befriend each other. What I will do to get
a more justified future where things are peaceful is still very much a mystery, but
maybe this is the site where I will update things below this paragraph of text as 
I accomplish things most likely with help of a lot of other atleast equally important
people.

- [ ] specify more

My personal special area of knowledge that could maybe be used to make peoples lives
better is in information technology and in accessibility. I find it nearly crotesque
that people view accessibility as an afterthought or not a thought at all instead of
it being a thing that is naturally in the very center of design process of different
products and infrastructure. While I do not yet hold a certificate for accessible
design I have still done more for accessibility than the major websites of the world
who are laughably bad at making their designs accessible or even readable for people
with different conditions.

- [ ] create a todo list on projects that help on things that are needed now
- [ ] google github repositories that work on assistive products

The writing of this site will have me drop checkboxes in this md file that have tasks
that I have assigned for me to do to make this site more informative of the progress
of my mission to make the world a better place.
