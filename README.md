## How I work during these?

I simply just have a timer that I set to two hours and then I do work as hard
as I possibly can during that time. After that I am just taking a 15 minute 
break just to then repeat the cycle 4 to 5 times per day. This might sound
like a tough deal if you are lazy, but I quarantee and stand by me not being
such thing or even close to it. I work harder than you.

## December to December resolutions 2024-2025

- [ ] Read 12 books
- [ ] Go exercise everyday (atleast a walk)
- [ ] eat properly
- [ ] sleep well

### Exercise notes

### Books that I have read (and what I learned)

#### 2/12 Upeaa Työtä - Lauri Järvilehto (currently on page 0)

#### 1/12 Tohtori Kuka ja autonien hyökkäys (currently on page 34- Stopped right there because I remembered I had already read this fucking book xD)

As I have been reading this book I cannot stop myself from thinking that the
current Disney run version of Doctor Who is actually just fucking dogshit. In
this book the people who have been introduced in it have had their reasonable
doubts on who or what everything that is alien to them is and have been pretty
normal in all other ways too. 

This book reflects a bit of sexism which I guess was just normal in the 1970s.

### Misc

## 4.12.2024 (WIP)

### My feels during the week

#### Beginning

As of late evening 27.11. I feel good for the coming week because I get to
just use my computer for hours and practice using Android Studio and make some
really funny applications. Although I have to complete tasks from the fullstack
open course and those feel like shit honestly to complete, there are some fun
tasks on my plate too and I get to spend time with my family too :)

### Goals achieved

Upon further investigation of my goals list I do not want to complete the unity
tasks because the terms of conditions can just fuck me over at any moment
if given the chance. They already tried to fuck over established game devs
not so long ago and I do not have the confidence to say that they will not try
again soon but harder than the last time.

Because the game jams of the year that are locally attendable are pretty much
gone and done with already I will just create three new tasks for this week
that have the names of the hackathons that I want to attend next year. They
will for sure certainly be fun because without fail all of the game jams were
fun that I had the pleasure of attending this year.

For clarity purposes I will have the finishing fullstackopen task split up in
sections in this weeks goals. Apparently I have already completed the first two
of the parts in it so I will be marking those parts as complete from here on
out. I have no idea as to how long completing this god forsaken course in full
so that I will have the opportunity of having 3 free job interviews will take.

The first time that I tried to download android studio this week it crashed my
brave-browser installation. That thing is such a fat piece of shit software
that that can and will happen if you are stupid enough to try android studio
from JetBrains. Be warned, you are not in for a good time or a particularly 
long time. Android will cause cancer.

I started the novel writing course from the youtube channel NovelWriting as the
story writing course that I will be completing here. My initial feel to the thing
is that it seems decent enough for me to spend my time on completing in full.
The views to likes ratio is decent enough that it might not even be botted
and the methodology in the first video sounds nice enough.

To learn how to write good and complex characters I will watch two videos in
full. Namely "How to write fantasy character arcs better than 99 % of writers
by Jed Herne (haha funny last name xD) and "Lecture #9: Characters" by 
Brandon Sanderson. All of this will most likely be fun and I'm excited to 
eventually get around doing it.

## 27.11.2024

### Goals

Becoming a game developer sounds like a fun thing to do professionally so that
is what I am trying to do here

- [X] use android studio for something
- [ ] finish my first godot project
- [X] go through a unity course
- [X] make a unity game
- [ ] attend a game hackathon
- [ ] go through a story building course
- [ ] write a story
- [ ] go through a character building course
- [ ] build a character
- [ ] finish the math courses that are part of my degree
- [ ] finish fullstackopen

### Hope is fleeting

This is the first post that I made right after creating whatever this ends up
being. Keep in mind that I have no idea or plan as to what I want to do with
this. However, the general direction that I want to make my life be is that
I get a job as a professional software engineer.

I'm way too aware of the fact that AI will be fucking me hard

# Opinions

The following opinion pieces usually are from my own observations and probably
cannot be verified or replicated in all instances. Usually they will however be
very reasonable and I will show how I got to that conclusion in them. I will 
never for example directly or indirectly say "_ is bad" without having a 
justifiable reason for it. 

## You should actively try to think for yourself

The benefits of thinking really should be obvious, but evidently they are not,
and many of the events that have happened very recently are the proof.
Please, please, please just try to think even for a week when you read something
the answers to the questions that many teachers for text analysis classes tell
you, namely: who, where, how, when and why.

Natural stupidity is fine, but you should still aspire to be better.
